# webDemos
This repository contains simple demo sites designed while I play with different beginner web technologies.

### How to try

Open a new directory and `git clone` this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikeymop/webDemos.git

You can then open any of the `index.html`s by opening them with your browser.
